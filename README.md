Project Summary:
We want to do an interactive convex hull program that is a pedagogical aid for convex hull algorithms, more specifically Jarvis' March. We will allow users to create the input space by inputting vertices with their cursor on a 2d grid. Then we will compute the convex hull of all the vertices that the user inputted. There will be visual aid to assist with stepping through the algorithm, as well as visual feedback when the user manipulates vertices on the grid.
We hope this program can impact students, teachers, and professionals looking to learn more about convex hull algorithms and how they work.
