    <h1> Homepage </h1>
    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> We want to do an interactive convex hull program that is a pedagogical aid for convex hull algorithms, more specifically Jarvis' March. We will allow users to create the input space by inputting vertices with their cursor on a 2d grid. Then we will compute the convex hull of all the vertices that the user inputted. There will be visual aid to assist with stepping through the algorithm, as well as visual feedback when the user manipulates vertices on the grid.
We hope this program can impact students, teachers, and professionals looking to learn more about convex hull algorithms and how they work. </p>

    <h2> Pseudocode Information </h2>
    <p> The psuedocode shown to the right of our program showcases how the program uses Jarvis March to compute the convex hull. The first thing it would do is to find the leftmost point from the points inputted by the user. The point will be saved as point P. Afterwards, for each point it comes across, the program finds the point that is the most conter-clockwise from point P. That point will be stored as point Q in the output convex hull. 
    Finally, the program will set point P as Q for the next iteration. </p>

    <h2> Additions </h2>
    <p> In addition to the implementation of the Jarvis's March algorithm and the program, we added a few things to help enhance our convex hull visualization. The first addition we made was to add a dragging mechanism to the created points on the grid. That way, if the program is in a pause state and the convex hull isn't created yet, the user can move the points around. This addition enables the user to have the freedom to modify and manipulate the convex hull, creating new variations of the hull.
    Another addition we made was incorporating the matrix to the program. The default matrix is the identity matrix, but the user can choose to change the values of the matrix's first two rows. This in turn will impact the size of the convex hull as it will change the placement of the points inputted by the user to accompany the size of the hull. For example, if the user replaces the "1"'s in the matrix with a 2, the hull will become twice its original size  </p>
