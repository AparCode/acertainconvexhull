    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> We want to do an interactive convex hull program that is a pedagogical aid for convex hull algorithms, more specifically Jarvis' March. We will allow users to create the input space by inputting vertices with their cursor on a 2d grid. Then we will compute the convex hull of all the vertices that the user inputted. There will be visual aid to assist with stepping through the algorithm, as well as visual feedback when the user manipulates vertices on the grid.
We hope this program can impact students, teachers, and professionals looking to learn more about convex hull algorithms and how they work. </p>

    <h2> Pseudocode Information </h2>
    <p> The psuedocode shown to the right of our program showcases how the program uses Jarvis March to compute the convex hull. The first thing it would do is to find the leftmost point from the points inputted by the user. The point will be saved as point P. Afterwards, for each point it comes across, the program finds the point that is the most conter-clockwise from point P. That point will be stored as point Q in the output convex hull. 
    Finally, the program will set point P as Q for the next iteration. </p>
